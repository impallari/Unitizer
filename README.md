# Unitizer Plugin for Glyphs

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). After installation, it will add the menu item *View > Show Unitizer*.

It's helpful for working in Unitized fonts. It display *unit guidelines* in the background (correspondong to a value that you can configure at will) of the current glyph in Edit view.

### Unitized fonts?

Through history, type designers have used many different unit systems, for many different reasons.

For example:
- 1 unit, for Monospaced fonts
- 11 & 12 units, used by the IBM Executive Typewriter
- 18 units, used by Monotype
- 36 units, used by Lumitype
- 48 units, used by Berthold
- 54 units, used by many Photo-typesetting equipments and later Linotype
- 96 units, used by Later Monotype

In the age of digital font-editors we can use a 1000 units system. We have extreme liberty and that is a good thing, but sometimes it's useful to put some constraints to ourselves and adopt a more restrained scheme.

Whatever the unit system you want to work with, using this plugin all you have to do is to define the size of *your unit* and set a custom parameter, and you will get handy guidelines that will make your life easier.
